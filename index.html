            <h1>CLOUD-BASED VR DATA MANAGEMENT PLATFORM</h1></center>
        </header>
        <p>A cloud-based VR data management platform is a centralized, scalable infrastructure designed to handle the complex data requirements of Virtual Reality (VR) environments. This platform manages all aspects of data associated with VR experiences, from user interactions and session tracking to the storage of assets like 3D models, textures, and VR environment data. It also facilitates the distribution, analysis, and collaboration of VR data, ensuring that users and developers can access, modify, and enhance their VR experiences with ease. </p>

     <center>
     <p>Object storage is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects, rather than as files or blocks. In this system, each object typically consists of the data itself, metadata, and a unique identifier. It is designed to store large amounts of unstructured data, such as photos, videos, backups, and logs. Object storage is highly scalable, cost-efficient, and designed for distributed environments, making it ideal for cloud-based applications. </p>
    </center> <p>BLOCK STORAGE</p>

     width="250px">
     <center>
        <p> Block storage is a type of data storage where data is stored in fixed-size blocks, and each block has its own address but does not include metadata about the data it contains. This is different from object storage (which uses objects with metadata) and file storage (which uses files within a hierarchical directory structure). Block storage provides low-level, raw storage that can be formatted and partitioned into file systems or used by databases, operating systems, and applications.</p>

     <p>FILE STORAGE</p>

     <center>
        <p>Cloud file storage refers to a type of online storage service where files and data are stored on remote servers (typically in data centers) and accessed over the internet. This form of storage enables users to store, access, share, and collaborate on files from anywhere, using any device with internet access. Cloud file storage providers manage the infrastructure, ensuring scalability, security, and availability. </p>

     <p> DATA STORAGE</p>

     <center>
         <p>Cloud data archiving refers to the process of storing infrequently accessed or older data in the cloud for long-term retention, backup, and retrieval when necessary. Unlike primary storage, which is designed for active and frequently accessed data, archiving is used for data that doesn't require regular use but still needs to be preserved for regulatory compliance, historical reference, or disaster recovery. Cloud data archiving offers a cost-effective and scalable way to store large volumes of data while ensuring that it remains accessible and protected. </p>

     <p> BACKUP AND DISASTER RECOVERY</p>
     <img src="back.png"

     <center> <p> Backup and disaster recovery (BDR) are essential components of an organization's IT strategy to ensure business continuity, data protection, and resilience in the event of data loss, system failure, or catastrophic events. Hereâ€™s an overview of each concept:</p>
